# ðŸ§ª Final project - Racket movement detection using neural network model on Arduino Nano BLE 33 - Redes de sensores electrÃ³nicos

##Introduction

The purpose of this final project is to obtain a device that could differenciate between different racket movements by previously doing some training procedures and model obtaining using **Edge Impulse ** platform.

##Data acquisition

Data for model training will be made using the same Arduino Nano BLE 33

###Methodology
