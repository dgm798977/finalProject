# ðŸ§ª Final project - Racket strokes detection using neural network model on Arduino Nano BLE 33 - Redes de sensores electrÃ³nicos

## Introduction

The purpose of this final project is to obtain a device that could differenciate between different racket strokes by previously doing some training procedures and model obtaining using  **Edge Impulse** platform. 

Project will be divided into data acquisition, modelling/training and final implementation.

## Data acquisition

Data for model training will be obtained using the same Arduino Nano BLE 33. We will need to attach the Arduino BLE into our rackets in a way that could detect both the impact of the ball and movements of the racket while doing different strokes.

Data collected will need to be previously pre-classified and sent to Edge Impulse as a way to properly train the data.

### Methodology

###Population sample
Data acquisition has been done with the colaboration of 3 different persons, having used a *FrontÃ³n* as a way of receiving balls in a more controlled way.

###Electronic functioning
As indicated before, Arduino Nano 33 BLE will be the board used as the sensing device of the different strokes done. In order to not have the board connected to a computer which would be used as the *data uploader* to the **Edge Impulse** environment, data will be sent to an ESP32 dev Board using the BLE capability of both devices, being the ESP32 the one to connect to the **API Ingestion** of Edge Impulse. Using  the API Ingestion procedure makes it easy to upload bunch of data directly to the platform.
This way, we will have the data ready to be processed on the project on following steps.

##Modelling & Training
After having obtained a considerable amount of samples of our different strokes to identify we will have to dig into the process of modelling and training of our neural network deployment. As we don't have many different strokes to classify, the structure of the Neural Network will be kept simple, keeping the standard layers Edge Impulse suggests. 

Training will also be done by implementing the procedures Edge Impulse platform suggests.

#Final implementation

The result of a correct training will be tested again on a *FrontÃ³n*. To keep the experiment simple, different strokes will have to be identified by the board and results of identification will be represented by using different colors of the RGB LED the board has.
